Refactor Application Into Microservices

## Description
Split apart an application that was built in a traditional monolithic architecture into individual functionalities (microservices).\s  
In between main application and services we added a service registry that will know where to find the services in the infrastructure.\s   
The service registry will also provide some load balancing.\s
I added a communication layer to the main application that provides some resilience against outages.\s
