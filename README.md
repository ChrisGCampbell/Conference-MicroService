# Project
Refactor Application Into Microservices

## Description
    Split apart an application that was built in a traditional monolithic architecture into individual functionalities (microservices)  
    In between main application and services we added a service registry that will know where to find the services in the infrastructure.   
    The service registry will also provide some load balancing.
    I added a communication layer to the main application that provides some resilience against outages.
